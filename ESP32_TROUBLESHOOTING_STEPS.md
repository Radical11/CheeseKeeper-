# ESP32 Bluetooth Fix - Step by Step Guide

## ðŸ”§ **Step 1: Test with Simple Code**

1. **Upload the simple test code** (`esp32_simple_test.ino`) to your ESP32 first
2. **Open Serial Monitor** at 115200 baud rate
3. **Look for this output:**
   ```
   Starting ESP32 BLE Test...
   BLE Device initialized
   BLE Server created
   BLE Advertising started!
   Device name: cheesekeeper
   ESP32 is running and advertising...
   ```

4. **Check the LED:** It should blink every second
5. **Test the Flutter app:** Try connecting - you should see "ðŸŽ¯ Found target device: cheesekeeper!"

## ðŸ”§ **Step 2: If Simple Test Works**

If the simple test works, upload the full CheeseKeeper code (`esp32_cheesekeeper_fixed.ino`):

1. **Upload the fixed code**
2. **Check Serial Monitor** for:
   ```
   ======================================
       CheeseKeeper ESP32 Starting
   ======================================
   âœ“ LED initialized
   âœ“ Preferences initialized
   âœ“ BLE Device initialized: cheesekeeper
   âœ“ BLE Server created
   âœ“ BLE Service created
   âœ“ Response characteristic created
   âœ“ Command characteristic created
   âœ“ BLE Service started
   âœ“ BLE Advertising started!
   ESP32 is ready and advertising as:
   Device Name: cheesekeeper
   ```

3. **LED should flash 3 times, then blink rapidly** (indicating advertising)

## ðŸ”§ **Step 3: If Nothing Works**

### Check Hardware:
1. **Power:** Make sure ESP32 has stable power (try different USB cable/port)
2. **Board:** Try pressing the RESET button on ESP32
3. **Upload:** Make sure code uploads successfully without errors

### Check Arduino IDE Settings:
1. **Board:** Select correct ESP32 board (ESP32 Dev Module)
2. **Port:** Select correct COM port
3. **Libraries:** Install required libraries:
   - ArduinoJson
   - ESP32 BLE Arduino (should be built-in)

### Check Serial Monitor:
1. **Baud Rate:** Set to 115200
2. **Connection:** Make sure ESP32 is connected via USB
3. **Errors:** Look for any error messages during startup

## ðŸ”§ **Step 4: Common Issues & Solutions**

### Issue: "Brownout detector was triggered"
**Solution:** Use better power supply or add `WRITE_PERI_REG(RTC_CNTL_BROWN_OUT_REG, 0);`

### Issue: "BLE initialization failed"
**Solution:** Try different ESP32 board or reset the ESP32

### Issue: "No serial output at all"
**Solution:** 
- Check USB cable
- Check COM port selection
- Try different USB port
- Press RESET button while connected

### Issue: "Code uploads but ESP32 doesn't run"
**Solution:**
- Press RESET button after upload
- Check if ESP32 enters bootloader mode (hold BOOT button while pressing RESET)

## ðŸ”§ **Step 5: Verify Connection**

Once ESP32 is advertising, your Flutter app should show:

```
[BluetoothService] ðŸ“¡ Found device: "cheesekeeper" (platform: "cheesekeeper", adv: "cheesekeeper") [XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX] RSSI: -XX
[BluetoothService] ðŸŽ¯ Found target device: "cheesekeeper"!
[BluetoothService] ðŸ”— Attempting to connect to device: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
[BluetoothService] âœ… Connected successfully!
```

## ðŸ”§ **Step 6: LED Status Indicators**

- **Fast blink (every 250ms):** ESP32 is advertising, waiting for connection
- **Slow blink (every 1000ms):** Connected but not authenticated
- **Solid ON:** Connected and authenticated
- **OFF:** Not connected

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Checklist:**

- [ ] ESP32 has power and shows activity LED
- [ ] Code uploads successfully to ESP32
- [ ] Serial Monitor shows "BLE Advertising started!"
- [ ] ESP32 LED is blinking (indicating it's running)
- [ ] Flutter app can scan and finds other BLE devices
- [ ] Android phone has Bluetooth enabled and permissions granted

## ðŸ†˜ **If All Else Fails:**

1. **Try a different ESP32 board** - Hardware might be faulty
2. **Use Arduino IDE's BLE examples** - Test with built-in examples first
3. **Check ESP32 board package version** - Update to latest in Arduino IDE
4. **Try with a BLE scanner app** from Play Store to verify ESP32 is advertising

The most common issue is that the ESP32 code isn't running at all. Make sure you see serial output first!
